<p><strong>Important note on early milestone release:</strong><br />
If a milestone’s requirements are fully met ahead of schedule, the
milestone can be demonstrated, approved, and invoiced/released early.
This keeps cash flow smooth and rewards fast progress.</p>

the report will show an overall score broken down by Peer, Direct
Report, Supervisor, Self, and Other as well as the industry benchmark
and GEOnorm for their group. - <strong>For the Involved-Leader and
Involved-Blocker</strong>, the reports will resemble the one from the
Digital Ocean Legacy reports, which are also located in the Slack
Channel for this platform - need to make sure these details are captured
here; This will include the person’s overall scores (means for all
dimensions) and then for each dimension, the target’s score for a given
dimension compared to the GEONorm and the Industry Benchmark. This will
also include feedback as described below. - Indicators for suggested
improvement areas will be shown in each dimension breakdown.</p>

text inputs from user assessments rather than feedback from the feedback
library.</p>

read, update, and delete report templates for each assessment. - These
templates will be used to generate custom reports for each survey. -

and off. - Clients will have the ability to customize the wording of
labels and headings in the report. - One digital delivery method for
completed reports (either automated email or secure in-app retrieval –
whichever proves most efficient during development).</p>
<h3 id="milestone-acceptance-criteria-phases-13">4. Milestone Acceptance
Criteria (Phases 1–3)</h3>
<p>A milestone is considered complete and payable when:</p>
<ul>
<li>All listed features in that phase are implemented and deployed to
the shared staging environment (Vercel + Supabase).<br />
</li>
<li>The functionality is reasonably viable and usable for its intended
purpose (i.e., a reasonable person would consider the feature “built and
working”).<br />
</li>
<li>The vast majority of normal-use test cases function correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>This does <strong>not</strong> require 100 % bug-free perfection or
final visual polish. Minor bugs, rare edge cases, and preferential
styling/UI adjustments are expected and will be addressed in Phase 4
without delaying milestone payment.</p>
<p>The experience working on the v1 re-launch combined with many years
of building similar platforms gives me deep insight into your exact
needs, so the core functionality delivered in Phases 1-3 will already be
very close to the final desired state.</p>
<h3 id="phase-4---revisions-edge-case-fixes-enhancements">5. Phase 4 -
Revisions, Edge-Case Fixes &amp; Enhancements</h3>
<p>Phase 4 is reserved for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixing any remaining bugs or edge cases discovered during real
use<br />
</li>
<li>Preferential revisions (layout tweaks, wording changes, small UX
improvements, etc.)<br />
</li>
<li>Final polish before production launch</li>
</ul>
<p>Priorities will be agreed together after a full demo/review of Phases
1-3.</p>
<p><strong>Scope protection for Phase 4:</strong><br />
This phase is capped at approximately <strong>20 hours</strong> of work
included in the fixed price. If requested revisions clearly exceed the
original agreed specifications (e.g., major new features), we will
discuss and quote those separately.</p>
<p>The only currently anticipated area that could potentially generate
open-ended customization is advanced report template
design/customization. While the base report templates and export
functionality will be complete in Phase 3, highly bespoke or iteratively
evolving report layouts can become open-ended. Should this occur, we
will either (a) complete a reasonable level of customization within the
20-hour cap, or (b) table further enhancements for a future phase at an
additional fixed price. All other features in the system are standard,
well-understood web-application patterns that I have built many times
and can deliver with high confidence.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-included-in-the-fixed-price">6. What Is Included in the
Fixed Price</h3>
<ul>
<li>All functionality as described in the scope document (Phases
1–4)<br />
</li>
<li>Staging environment accessible to you at all times<br />
</li>
<li>Responsive, professional Tailwind-based UI (minimalist but clean and
branded where specified)<br />
</li>
<li>PDF, Excel, and CSV report export with bulk-download
capability<br />
</li>
<li>One digital delivery method for completed reports (either automated
email or secure in-app retrieval – whichever proves most efficient
during development)<br />
</li>
<li>Full production deployment and post-launch knowledge transfer<br />
</li>
<li>Up to 20 hours of Phase 4 revisions/fixes as described above</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="what-is-explicitly-excluded-available-as-future-phases-if-desired">7.
What Is Explicitly Excluded (available as future phases if desired)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Highly complex or open-ended report template customization beyond
the base system delivered in Phase 3<br />
</li>
<li>Advanced AI features and integrations. (This is not a priority for
the initial release, but could be added in a future phase if
desired.)</li>
<li>Ongoing maintenance or hosting fees (Vercel and Supabase costs are
paid directly by you)<br />
</li>
<li>Third-party paid services (e.g., premium email delivery, advanced AI
features, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="timeline-estimate">8. Timeline Estimate</h3>
<p>Assuming prompt feedback and approval at each milestone:<br />
Start → Finish in approximately <strong>6–8 weeks</strong> (mid-February
2026 target production launch).</p>
<h3 id="acceptance">9. Acceptance</h3>
<p>Let me know when you want to move forward or if you need adjustments
to the scope or timeline.</p>
<p>Thank you for the trust — I’m excited to deliver Involved Talent v2
quickly, on budget, and to a standard you’ll be proud of.</p>
