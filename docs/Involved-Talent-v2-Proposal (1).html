        </ul>

        <h3 class="page-break">Phase 3: Feedback Management and Reporting</h3>

        <h4>Report Management</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Admins will be able to generate reports for surveys.</li>
            <li>Reports will be generated for each survey.</li>
            <li>Managers can view reports for their surveys on a web page.</li>
            <li>Reports can be exported to PDF, Excel, and CSV.
                <ul class="nested-list">
                    <li>Need bulk downloads - zipped file or something like that.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>For <strong>the 360</strong>, each dimension, the report will show an overall score broken down by Peer, Direct Report, Supervisor, Self, and Other as well as the industry benchmark and GEOnorm for their group.</li>
            <li><strong>For the Involved-Leader and Involved-Blocker</strong>, the reports will resemble the one from the Digital Ocean Legacy reports, which are also located in the Slack Channel for this platform - need to make sure these details are captured here; This will include the person's overall scores (means for all dimensions) and then for each dimension, the target's score for a given dimension compared to the GEONorm and the Industry Benchmark. This will also include feedback as described below.</li>
            <li>Indicators for suggested improvement areas will be shown in each dimension breakdown.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Feedback Management</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Admins will be able to create, read, update, and delete feedback.</li>
            <li>Feedback will have the following details:
                <ul class="nested-list">
                    <li>Assessment</li>
                    <li>Dimension</li>
                    <li>Type</li>
                    <li>Feedback</li>
                    <li>Created At</li>
                    <li>Updated At</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Admins can bulk upload feedback libraries from a spreadsheet.
                <ul class="nested-list">
                    <li>The spreadsheet should have the following columns: Assessment, Dimension, Type (Overall/Specific), Feedback</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Non-360 assessments will have feedback for each dimension.</li>
            <li>All users get overall feedback.</li>
            <li>The reports will pull <strong>ONE</strong> specific feedback entry randomly for each dimension.</li>
            <li>360 assessments will use text inputs from user assessments rather than feedback from the feedback library.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Report Templates</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Admins will be able to create, read, update, and delete report templates for each assessment.</li>
            <li>These templates will be used to generate custom reports for each survey.</li>
            <li>They will override the default report template for the assessment.</li>
            <li>Clients will have the ability to toggle different report components on and off.</li>
            <li>Clients will have the ability to customize the wording of labels and headings in the report.</li>
            <li>One digital delivery method for completed reports (either automated email or secure in-app retrieval – whichever proves most efficient during development).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="page-break">4. Milestone Acceptance Criteria (Phases 1–3)</h2>
        <p>A milestone is considered complete and payable when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All listed features in that phase are implemented and deployed to the shared staging environment (Vercel + Supabase).</li>
            <li>The functionality is reasonably viable and usable for its intended purpose (i.e., a reasonable person would consider the feature "built and working").</li>
            <li>The vast majority of normal-use test cases function correctly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This does <strong>not</strong> require 100% bug-free perfection or final visual polish. Minor bugs, rare edge cases, and preferential styling/UI adjustments are expected and will be addressed in Phase 4 without delaying milestone payment.</p>
        <p>The experience working on the v1 re-launch combined with many years of building similar platforms gives me deep insight into your exact needs, so the core functionality delivered in Phases 1-3 will already be very close to the final desired state.</p>

        <h2>5. Phase 4 - Revisions, Edge-Case Fixes &amp; Enhancements</h2>
        <p>Phase 4 is reserved for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixing any remaining bugs or edge cases discovered during real use</li>
            <li>Preferential revisions (layout tweaks, wording changes, small UX improvements, etc.)</li>
            <li>Final polish before production launch</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Priorities will be agreed together after a full demo/review of Phases 1-3.</p>
        
        <div class="note-box">
            <strong>Scope protection for Phase 4:</strong> This phase is capped at approximately <strong>20 hours</strong> of work included in the fixed price. If requested revisions clearly exceed the original agreed specifications (e.g., major new features), we will discuss and quote those separately.
        </div>
        
        <p>The only currently anticipated area that could potentially generate open-ended customization is advanced report template design/customization. While the base report templates and export functionality will be complete in Phase 3, highly bespoke or iteratively evolving report layouts can become open-ended. Should this occur, we will either (a) complete a reasonable level of customization within the 20-hour cap, or (b) table further enhancements for a future phase at an additional fixed price. All other features in the system are standard, well-understood web-application patterns that I have built many times and can deliver with high confidence.</p>

        <h2>6. What Is Included in the Fixed Price</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All functionality as described in the scope document (Phases 1–4)</li>
            <li>Staging environment accessible to you at all times</li>
            <li>Responsive, professional Tailwind-based UI (minimalist but clean and branded where specified)</li>
            <li>PDF, Excel, and CSV report export with bulk-download capability</li>
            <li>One digital delivery method for completed reports (either automated email or secure in-app retrieval – whichever proves most efficient during development)</li>
            <li>Full production deployment and post-launch knowledge transfer</li>
            <li>Up to 20 hours of Phase 4 revisions/fixes as described above</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. What Is Explicitly Excluded (available as future phases if desired)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Highly complex or open-ended report template customization beyond the base system delivered in Phase 3</li>
            <li>Advanced AI features and integrations. (This is not a priority for the initial release, but could be added in a future phase if desired.)</li>
            <li>Ongoing maintenance or hosting fees (Vercel and Supabase costs are paid directly by you)</li>
            <li>Third-party paid services (e.g., premium email delivery, advanced AI features, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Timeline Estimate</h2>
        <p>Assuming prompt feedback and approval at each milestone:<br>
        Start → Finish in approximately <strong>6–8 weeks</strong> (mid-February 2026 target production launch).</p>

        <h2>9. Acceptance</h2>
        <p>Let me know when you want to move forward or if you need adjustments to the scope or timeline.</p>
        <p>Thank you for the trust – I'm excited to deliver Involved Talent v2 quickly, on budget, and to a standard you'll be proud of.</p>
