- Set up authentication helpers and SSR support
- Created environment configuration structure

#### Project Architecture
- **Folder Structure:**
  - `src/app/` - Next.js App Router pages
  - `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
  - `src/lib/` - Utility libraries and configurations
  - `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions

- **Problem:** Users weren't being redirected to dashboard after successful login/signup
- **Solution:** Enhanced middleware and added programmatic redirects
- **Changes:**
  - **Middleware Updates:** Redirect authenticated users away from auth pages
  - **Login Form:** Added `router.push('/dashboard')` after successful authentication
  - **SignOut Button:** Functional sign out with proper redirect
